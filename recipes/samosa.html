      <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix flour, salt and butter until the mixture resembles
        fine bread crumbs. Pour in water, using more (up to approximately 1/4
        cup) if necessary to make a smooth dough. Pat into a ball. Place on a
        lightly floured surface and knead 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth
        and elastic. Return to the bowl, cover and set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat oil in a large, deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>

      <li>
        Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in onion,
        garlic, green chile peppers and ginger. Cook 5 minutes, or until onions
        are golden brown. Stir in turmeric, chili powder, ground lamb and salt.
        Cook until the lamb meat is evenly brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in
        garam masala and lemon juice. Continue cooking 5 minutes, then remove
        from heat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Divide dough into 15 equal portions. Roll portions into balls, then
        flatten into 4 inch circles. Cut each circle in half. Dampen edges and
        form semicircles into cones. Fill cones with equal portions of the lamb
        meat mixture. Dampen top and bottom edges of cones, and pinch to seal.
      </li>

      <li>
        Carefully lower cones into preheated oil a few at a time. Fry until
        golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.
